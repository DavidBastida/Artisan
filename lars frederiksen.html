        Lars Frederiksen is an American punk rock guitarist/vocalist. He was born as Lars Everett Dapello on <i> August 30, 1971. </i> Frederiksen grew up just outside of San Jose California in a town called<strong> Campbell.</strong> Frederiksen was rasied by a single mother, Minna Dapello and also had a brother, Robert, who died of a brain aneurysm when Lars was only a boy. Throughout Frederiksens youth he was exposed to drugs through his involvement in the Hells Angels, where he would run drugs for the gang.
